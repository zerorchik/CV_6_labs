# PyOpenGL Direct Documentation Generator

To Produce the PyOpenGL documentation-set (you need PyOpenGL installed,
so checkout this branch separately from the master branch):

```
	./acquireoriginal.py
	./samples.py
	./references.py 
	./generate.py 
```

which will create a manual-X.Y directory and place the resulting HTML files
into it.
